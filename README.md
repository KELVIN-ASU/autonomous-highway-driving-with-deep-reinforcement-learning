# Autonomous Highway Driving with Deep Reinforcement Learning

This project implements and compares four deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms — DQN, PPO, TD3, and SAC — for autonomous highway driving using the `highway-env` simulation environment. All agents are trained using Multi-layer perceptron(MLP) based policies, and cover discrete and continuous action spaces are explored.

## Project Objective

The goal is to train reinforcement learning agents to learn safe and efficient driving behavior, specifically:

- Maintaining high speed without collisions
- Following lane discipline
- Navigating dynamic traffic environments

## Algorithms Implemented

| Algorithm | Type                  | Action Space | Notes                                      |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| DQN       | Value-based           | Discrete     | Prone to instability and high collision    |
| PPO       | Policy gradient       | Discrete     | Stable and realistic driving behavior      |
| TD3       | Actor-Critic          | Continuous   | No collisions but unrealistic off-road use |
| SAC       | Actor-Critic + Entropy| Continuous   | Balanced learning with low collisions      |
